## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-cpp.git


   Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd dsa-cpp
Compile the desired C++ source file using g++:

bash
Copy code
g++ -o output-file-name source-file.cpp
Run the compiled program:

bash
Copy code
./output-file-name
Usage
Each program is self-contained, demonstrating specific data structure and algorithm functionalities. To test a program, compile and run it as mentioned above.

Example Usage
For example, to run the program for sorting algorithms:

bash
Copy code
g++ -o sorting sorting.cpp
./sorting
